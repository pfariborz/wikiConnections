## Overview

Ever play a game where you choose a page in Wikipedia and see how many
hops it takes to get to a different page in Wikipedia? For example, how
many hops does it take to get from Cheese to Antartica. This program 
takes a start and end subject and determines how many hops it takes in 
Wikipedia to get there. 

Using a CLI the user enters a starting page/subject and an end goal for
the program. They are returned back with the path it took to get there.

### Additional Configurations/Customizations

In order to chart the graph, the program has implemmentations of both
Depth First Search and Breadth First Search, the user has the ability to
choose which algorithm they prefer. 

Another configurable choice the user has is the maximum number of hops
the program is allowed to take to find the path. The default value set
for maximum number of hops is 20.
